This is a simple shell project by Karanja Martin and Chillavert Isiaho.

In this project, my partner and I are developing a UNIX command line interpreter base in the sh shell
SIMPLE SHELL

A simple UNIX command line interpreter that can handle basic command execution, environment variables, built-in commands, and logical operators. Usage

To use the shell, simply run the executable sh.

The shell displays a prompt and waits for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line. The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed. The command lines are simple, made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
